# Green-Screen

## Overview
"Green-Screen" is a Python script designed to automate the process of green screen (chroma key) compositing. This script allows users to easily merge two images: a foreground image containing a green screen and a background image of their choice.

## How It Works
The script works by detecting the green color in the foreground image and replacing it with the background image. This process is commonly used in video production and photography to create composite images or videos.

## Installation
To get started with "Green-Screen", follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yugankahuja/Green-Screen.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the required dependencies (if any).

## Usage
To use the script, you need to have two images:
1. A foreground image with a green screen.
2. A background image to replace the green screen.

Run the script with the images as arguments:
```
python greenscreen.py <foreground_image_path> <background_image_path>
```

The script will process the images and output a composite image with the green screen replaced by the chosen background.

## Example
Here's an example of what "Green-Screen" can do:
